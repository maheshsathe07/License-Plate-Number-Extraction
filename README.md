# License Plate Number Extraction

Welcome to the License Plate Number Extraction project! This project utilizes OpenCV and EasyOCR to extract license plate numbers from images.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to provide a simple yet effective tool for extracting license plate numbers from images using computer vision techniques. With the combination of OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for optical character recognition, this system can accurately detect and extract license plate numbers from various sources.

## Usage

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/maheshsathe07/License-Plate-Number-Extraction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python RealTimeNumberPlateDetection.py
   ```

2. **Input Data:**
   - Provide images containing license plates as input to the system.
